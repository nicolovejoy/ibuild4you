# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

iBuild4you.com — an AI-powered project intake system. A conversational agent guides non-technical users through discovery and produces a structured "living brief" that evolves over multiple sessions. Builders review briefs and annotate them; those annotations inform the agent's next session with the requester.

## Three Roles

- **Requester** — non-technical person with an app/website idea, chats with the agent
- **Agent** — conducts conversations, extracts structure, produces/updates the living brief
- **Builder** — reviews briefs on a dashboard, adds annotations that feed back into agent context

## Stack

- Next.js App Router on Vercel
- Firestore (`ibuild4you-a0c4d` Firebase project) — all DB access through API routes using Firebase Admin SDK, never from client components
- Firebase Auth with Google OAuth + passcode login
- Shared `apiFetch()` client helper with Bearer tokens
- React Query for state management
- Tailwind CSS v4 with @theme inline tokens
- Claude API (Sonnet) for agent conversations via SSE streaming

Architecture is cloned from NoteMaxxing (`/Users/nico/src/notemaxxing`). NoteMaxxing patterns are the reference for how things should be done here.

## Commands

```
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run type-check   # TypeScript check (tsc --noEmit)
npm run format       # Prettier format all files
npm test             # Run tests (vitest)
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
```

## Architecture

- `app/` — Next.js App Router pages and API routes
- `app/api/` — All data access goes through API routes using Firebase Admin SDK
- `lib/firebase/` — Client SDK (`client.ts`), Admin SDK (`admin.ts`), `apiFetch()` helper
- `lib/s3/` — S3 client for file storage (uploads go to `ibuild4you-files` bucket)
- `lib/api/` — Server-side auth helpers (`getAuthenticatedUser`, `requireAdmin`)
- `lib/hooks/` — React hooks (`useAuth`, `useDebounce`)
- `lib/query/` — React Query client config and hooks
- `lib/types/` — TypeScript types for all entities
- `lib/copy.ts` — All user-facing text centralized in one file for easy editing
- `lib/agent/` — Agent system prompt, prep prompt, welcome message generator, constants
- `components/ui/` — Reusable UI primitives (Button, Modal, Card, StatusMessage, etc.)
- `components/builder/` — Builder project view (sessions, brief, setup tabs)
- `components/maker/` — Maker project view (chat, brief card)
- `components/` — App-level components (ErrorBoundary, UserMenu)

Key pattern: clients call `apiFetch()` which attaches the Firebase Bearer token. API routes call `getAuthenticatedUser(request)` to verify the token server-side before accessing Firestore via `getAdminDb()`.

## Data Model

- **users** — identity (email, first_name, last_name), auto-populated from Google sign-in
- **approved_emails** — allowlist for sign-in (invite-only)
- **project_members** — role-based membership (owner, builder, apprentice, maker) with passcode for maker auth
- **projects** — one per maker engagement, includes agent config (session_mode, directives, opener), requester name/email, tracking fields (shared_at, last_nudged_at)
- **sessions** — each conversation between maker and agent, snapshots agent config at creation
- **messages** — individual messages within a session, role (user/agent) and timestamp, optional file_ids
- **files** — uploaded files (metadata in Firestore, bytes in S3 at `ibuild4you-files` bucket), scoped to project
- **briefs** — living brief for a project, structured and versioned, updated after each session
- **reviews** — builder annotations on a brief, feed back into agent context for next session

## Agent Behavior Rules

- Neutral, non-opinionated tone; slightly mirrors requester's writing style
- Plain language only — never UX jargon like "user journeys" or "microservices"
- Early sessions: broad discovery. Later sessions: more specific as brief fills in
- At natural checkpoints, summarize back for validation ("So you want X and Y but not Z, right?")
- System prompt includes: current living brief, builder review annotations, prior session history

## MVP Scope

Conversational intake → structured living brief → builder review → next session picks up where left off.

NOT in MVP: process flow diagrams, data architecture drafts, microservice sketches, comparable app analysis, whiteboard UI mockups.

## Testing & Deployment

- **Production-first testing**: We test in prod. No staging environment. This is fine while the app is invite-only and low-stakes — revisit when risk profile changes (payments, sensitive data, larger user base).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions runs `type-check`, `lint`, `build`, `test` before deploying to Vercel.
- **TDD when possible**: Write tests before implementation. Skip only when it genuinely doesn't fit (pure UI layout, exploratory prototyping).

## Code Style

This is a learning project (Max, 19, college freshman, is contributing). Code should be:
- Clear and straightforward — no clever abstractions
- Well-commented where non-obvious
- Following patterns established in NoteMaxxing

## Next Steps

1. Users & roles Phase 3: Names on `users` only, maker self-edit, remove names from `project_members`. Plan at `docs/users-and-roles-plan.md`.
2. Users & roles Phase 4: First-visit name prompt for nameless makers.
3. Fix turn indicator: role-aware labels (maker sees "Waiting for builder" / builder sees "Your turn"), and handle end-of-conversation state.
4. Remove `ADMIN_EMAILS` fallback once both admins have signed in post-deploy (check Firebase Console for `system_roles` on Max's doc).
5. Implement real-time multi-user sync (Firestore onSnapshot for messages). Plan at `.claude/plans/sprightly-juggling-storm.md`.
